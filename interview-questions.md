# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: it is a way for us to call keys in state without having to type out the full this.state. syntax everytime we nee need something.

  Researched answer: The object destructuring is a useful JS feature used to extract props from objects and bind them to variables. with object destructuring we can extract multiple properties in one statement, can access properties from nested objects, and can set a default value if the property doesn't exist.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
  A DOM event is something that happens to the document object model, something like an on change or an on click.

  Researched answer:
DOM events are actions that occurs as a result of the user action or as result of state change of the elements of a DOM tree.


3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: 
  A class is react's way of storing groups of information together under one thing, it's based on objects. Objects are simply just groups of information without the functionality of react.

  Researched answer:
  A class is a template for objects, an object is an instance of a class.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer:
  a div is a block level element, it takes up its own line. A span is an inline element so it doesn't create any line breaks.

  Researched answer:
to expand on my answer, it says that divs should be used to wrap sections of a document while spans are used to wrap around small portions of text, images, etc.


5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: React.Fragment is where we put everything that we want to render on screen. All component calls and such are stored in the react fragment.

  Researched answer:
  A react fragment allows us to return multiple elements in one component without extra nodes to the DOM.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:
  not sure but my guesses would be:
  -using state
  -different components
  -

  Researched answer:
-Flexible Layouts- Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will resize to any width.
-Media Queries- An extension to media types when targeting and including styles. Media queries allow designers to specify different styles for specific browser and device circumstances.
-Flexible Media- makes media scalable by changing the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming

  OOP refers to a type of programming where programmers define the data type of a data structure and the types of operations that can be applied to the data structure.

- irb

I'm not sure if this is the irb we're looking for but irb is the institutional review board that protects the rights and welfare of human research subjects.

- Instance variable

in OOP an instance variable is a variable defined in a class for which each instance of the class has a separate copy.

- Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has a syntax that is natural and easy to write.

- Class relationships

Unified Modeling Language defines five relationships that can exist between classes:
-inheritance
-association
-aggregation
-composition
-dependancy

- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby

-getter and setter methods allow us to access a class's instance variable from outside the class. 
Getters are used to get the value of an instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of am instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of an instance variable of some class.
